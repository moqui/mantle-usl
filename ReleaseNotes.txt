Mantle Business Artifacts - Universal Service Library Release Notes

===========================================================================
Release 2.0.1 - Not Yet Released
===========================================================================

Mantle Universal Service Library 2.0.1 is a patch level feature and bug fix
release. This release is based on Moqui Framework 2.1.1, mantle-udm 2.0.1.

New Features

- Various inline messages have been moved to LocalizedMessage records to
  not break translations on message changes, and to make long message
  localizable (with 255 char original limit); the following must be loaded
  on update to get the needed records (is install data file, not seed):
  - OrderInstallData.xml
- The create#PostalAddress, #TelecomNumber, #EmailAddress, and
  #PartyContactOther services no longer have a default contactMechPurposeId
  and only create PartyContactMech so that they can be created without
  PartyContactMech, FacilityContactMech, etc associations
- Similarly store#PartyContactInfo no longer default to primary purpose for
  TelecomNumber, EmailAddress, and PostalAddress which allows for things
  like creating a PostalAddress with phone and email that are associated
  with it but not with the Party or Facility
- GL Account Classes now support a contra flag (using optionIndicator=Y on
  the GL Account Class Enumeration records) so that contra classes can be
  mixed in with other classes such as Revenue, Asset, and Equity instead of
  having to be in a separate branch of the account classification tree
- Added transfer#FinancialAccount service to do direct transfer from one
  FinancialAccount to another

Bug Fixes

- Fix FinancialAccountServices.checkCreate#PaymentTrans service to support
  both Payments with type PtFinancialAccount and payments with types and
  instrument PiFinancialAccount to do the proper deposit or withdraw for
  each depending on the Payment parties (from or to being internal org)
- GL posting for Payments with a type other that PtFinancialAccount and
  with instrument PiFinancialAccount now determines GL account based on
  Replenish and Disbursement FA trans reasons so that it matches, and
  nets to zero against, the GL account used in the GL TX for the FA Trans
